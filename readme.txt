Provides a nice way to show a random cat photo on your site.

== Description ==
Random Cat provides a nice way to show a random cat photo/photos on your site. Every online user or at least the majority of the online users are big fans of cats so make them visit your site more often by providing them a fresh cat pic on every visit!

The plugin shows a different photo on every time the page loads. Meaning that every time the user clicks to a different page, a different picture will be displayed. You can choose how many cat photos you wish to show to your visitors. 

The plugin uses the The Cat API http://thecatapi.com/ to get images of cats. It makes a call every time a cat photo is needed.
